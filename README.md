## Overview

Welcome to the **AI Loyalty Maximizer Suite** repository! This project presents a comprehensive reference architecture for a conceptual, AI-first application designed for airline travel enthusiasts. The suite aims to provide intelligent, conversational assistance for:

1.  **Award Travel Optimization:** Helping users find the best ways to redeem their rewards currency (miles/points) for flights.
2.  **Revenue Flight Earnings Calculation & Crediting Advisor:** Assisting users in calculating the rewards (miles/points) and elite-qualifying metrics they will earn from paid flights, and advising on the optimal frequent flyer program for crediting.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a **portfolio piece and a detailed architectural blueprint**, showcasing the design of a sophisticated, cloud-native application built primarily on Amazon Web Services (AWS) managed services. It demonstrates advanced concepts in AI application development, solution architecture, data engineering, and cloud engineering.

The focus is on the architectural design, decision-making processes, and integration of modern technologies to solve a complex, real-world-inspired problem, including intelligent automation for knowledge base creation.

## Key Features & Technologies Showcased

* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Core of the solution.
* **Large Language Models (LLMs):**
    * Serving as the primary orchestrator for user interaction and tool invocation (e.g., leveraging models via Amazon Bedrock).
    * Utilized for advanced information extraction from diverse, semi-structured source documents (web pages, PDFs) to populate the knowledge base.
* **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Conceptual framework for LLMs to interact with specialized tools and agents.
* **GraphRAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation with Knowledge Graphs):** Utilizing graph databases (e.g., Amazon Neptune) combined with RAG techniques for accessing and reasoning over complex airline loyalty data.
* **Intelligent Data Ingestion & ETL Pipeline:**
    * Automated processing of manually gathered source documents (HTML, PDF, text).
    * **Amazon S3:** Landing zone for raw and processed data.
    * **Amazon Textract:** For OCR and table/form extraction from PDF/image documents.
    * **AWS Glue:** For complex ETL, data transformation, and applying Python-based parsing logic (including LLM integration for extraction).
    * **AWS Step Functions:** Orchestrating the multi-stage data ingestion and graph population pipeline.
    * **(Potentially) Amazon Athena:** For validating intermediate extracted data.
* **Serverless Architecture:** Prioritizing AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions, DynamoDB, and S3 for scalability and cost-effectiveness.
* **Cloud-Native on AWS:** Deep integration with a wide array of AWS managed services.
* **Comprehensive Architectural Design:** Including C4 modeling for software views, supplemented by enterprise architectural perspectives (Process, Physical/Deployment, Development).
* **DevOps & Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Considerations for CI/CD pipelines and managing infrastructure programmatically (e.g., AWS CDK/CloudFormation).

## Architectural Approach

The architecture detailed herein utilizes the **C4 model** (Context, Containers, Components) for its clarity in depicting software structure. This is augmented by broader **enterprise architectural views**â€”including Process, Physical (Deployment), and Development perspectivesâ€”to provide a holistic understanding suitable for complex, scalable systems. A key aspect of the design is the **AI-driven, automated pipeline for ingesting and transforming varied source data** into a structured knowledge graph, minimizing manual data entry and enhancing adaptability.

## Navigating This Repository

The complete architectural documentation is extensive and organized into several files for clarity.

* **Full Architectural Documentation:**
    * The primary, detailed architectural specification will be structured across multiple markdown files within the [`/docs`](./docs) directory. An overarching `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` or similar within `/docs` will serve as the main entry point that strings together or links to all other documentation sections.
    * Example structure:
        * Introduction: [`/docs/01_INTRODUCTION.md`](./docs/01_INTRODUCTION.md)
        * Business Context: [`/docs/02_BUSINESS_CONTEXT_AND_REQUIREMENTS.md`](./docs/02_BUSINESS_CONTEXT_AND_REQUIREMENTS.md)
        * ... and so on for all sections as per our agreed structure.
* **Architectural Diagrams:**
    * All diagrams (C4, AWS deployment, data flows, pipeline diagrams, etc.) are located in the [`/diagrams`](./diagrams) directory.
* **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):**
    * Key design decisions and their rationale are documented in the [`/adr`](./adr) directory.
