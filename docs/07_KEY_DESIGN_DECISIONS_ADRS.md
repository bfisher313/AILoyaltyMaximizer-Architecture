# 7. Key Design Decisions & Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Throughout the design process of the AI Loyalty Maximizer Suite, numerous architectural decisions have been made. Documenting these key decisions, including their context, alternatives considered, and the rationale for the chosen approach, is crucial for maintaining architectural consistency, facilitating future evolution, and onboarding new team members.

## 7.1. Introduction to Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a lightweight document that captures an architecturally significant decision, along with its context and consequences. ADRs provide a historical log of these decisions, helping to prevent "architecture by amnesia" where the reasoning behind a choice is lost over time.

For this project, ADRs would ideally be:
* **Numbered sequentially.**
* **Stored as separate Markdown files** in a dedicated `/adr` directory within the repository.
* **Version-controlled** alongside the rest of the architectural documentation and code.
* **Concise and focused** on a single architectural decision.

Each ADR typically includes sections such as:
* **Title:** A short descriptive title of the decision.
* **Status:** Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded.
* **Context:** The forces at play, issue, or problem being addressed.
* **Decision:** The chosen solution or approach.
* **Consequences:** The results of making this decision (positive, negative, trade-offs).
* **Alternatives Considered:** Brief description of other options and why they were not chosen.

## 7.2. Key Architectural Decisions for AI Loyalty Maximizer Suite

The following list outlines some of the key architectural decisions made for this suite. In a fully implemented project, each of these (and potentially others) would be documented in a dedicated ADR file within the `/adr` directory.

* **ADR-001: Primary Cloud Platform Selection**
    * **Decision:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) selected as the primary cloud platform.
    * **Rationale Snippet:** Leverage AWS's comprehensive suite of managed services for serverless compute, AI/ML, databases, data processing, and developer tools, aligning with the goal of a cloud-native, scalable, and resilient architecture. (Note: The architecture's core principles are designed to be adaptable to other major cloud providers, with AWS used for concrete service examples.)

* **ADR-002: Core Compute Strategy**
    * **Decision:** Adopt a "serverless-first" approach, primarily utilizing AWS Lambda for application logic and backend processing.
    * **Rationale Snippet:** To optimize for operational efficiency, automatic scaling, pay-per-use cost model, and reduced infrastructure management overhead.

* **ADR-003: Knowledge Graph Database Technology**
    * **Decision:** Amazon Neptune selected for implementing the loyalty program knowledge graph.
    * **Rationale Snippet:** Managed graph database service, supports openCypher and Gremlin, integrates well with the AWS ecosystem, suitable for modeling complex relationships in loyalty data.

* **ADR-004: User Profile Data Store**
    * **Decision:** Amazon DynamoDB selected for storing user profiles and preferences.
    * **Rationale Snippet:** Highly scalable, low-latency NoSQL database with a flexible schema, well-suited for user-specific data and serverless access patterns.

* **ADR-005: LLM Access and Orchestration Strategy**
    * **Decision:** Utilize Amazon Bedrock for accessing foundation Large Language Models and AWS Step Functions for orchestrating complex LLM interactions and MCP tool invocations.
    * **Rationale Snippet:** Bedrock provides managed access to various LLMs, simplifying integration. Step Functions offers robust, serverless workflow management for complex, multi-step AI processes.

* **ADR-006: Data Ingestion Pipeline Technology Stack**
    * **Decision:** Employ a combination of Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Amazon Textract, AWS Glue (ETL with Python and LLM integration), and AWS Step Functions for the automated knowledge base ingestion pipeline.
    * **Rationale Snippet:** Provides a scalable, event-driven, and AI-augmented pipeline for processing diverse source documents and populating the knowledge graph.

* **ADR-007: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tooling**
    * **Decision:** AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) preferred for defining and provisioning infrastructure, synthesizing to AWS CloudFormation.
    * **Rationale Snippet:** Allows infrastructure definition in familiar programming languages, promotes modularity, and offers higher-level abstractions over raw CloudFormation.

* **ADR-008: Graph Query Language for Programmatic Access**
    * **Decision:** Prioritize openCypher for programmatic interaction with Amazon Neptune where appropriate.
    * **Rationale Snippet:** Declarative nature, wider adoption in the Cypher ecosystem, and potential for better query portability with other Cypher-based graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).

* **ADR-009: Scope Definition for "Award Travel Optimization" Feature**
    * **Decision:** Re-scope the feature to "Strategic Award Pathway Analysis," focusing on transfer partners, fixed/conceptual award values, and guidance, rather than live dynamic award availability searching.
    * **Rationale Snippet:** Addresses the complexities and reliability issues of accessing real-time dynamic award pricing for a conceptual portfolio project, focusing on the strengths of a curated knowledge graph.

* **ADR-010: Python Dependency Management Strategy**
    * **Decision:** Utilize Poetry for development-time dependency management and lock file generation, exporting to `requirements.txt` for packaging Lambda functions and Glue Python Shell job dependencies.
    * **Rationale Snippet:** Provides robust, deterministic dependency resolution for development while aligning with standard AWS packaging mechanisms.

*(This list is illustrative. More ADRs would be created as other significant decisions arise.)*

## 7.3. Location of ADR Files

All individual Architecture Decision Record (ADR) markdown files are, or will be, stored in the [`/adr`](../adr) directory of this repository.
