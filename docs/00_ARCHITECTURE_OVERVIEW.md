# AI Loyalty Maximizer Suite: Architecture Overview & Document Guide

**Version:** 0.2.0 (Enterprise View Enhancements) **Date:** May 25, 2025 **Status:** In Development

## 1. Purpose of This Document Set

This collection of documents provides a comprehensive reference architecture for the **AI Loyalty Maximizer Suite**, a conceptual AI-first application. It details the system's business context, driving requirements, logical and physical design on Amazon Web Services (AWS), data architecture, key architectural decisions, and considerations for security, scalability, and operations.

This documentation is intended for technical stakeholders, including architects, development leads, and engineers, to understand the design and underlying principles of the suite.

## 2. How to Read This Architecture

This architectural specification is organized into multiple, interlinked markdown files to allow for modularity and focused reading. It is recommended to start with the [Introduction (01_INTRODUCTION.md)](./01_INTRODUCTION.md) to understand the project's vision and scope, followed by the [Business Context and Requirements (02_BUSINESS_CONTEXT_AND_REQUIREMENTS.md)](./02_BUSINESS_CONTEXT_AND_REQUIREMENTS.md).

Subsequent sections delve into specific architectural domains. Diagrams, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), and illustrative examples are referenced and linked throughout the documentation.
