# 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns

Beyond the primary logical, data, and physical views of the architecture, several critical concerns span multiple components and layers of the AI Loyalty Maximizer Suite. These "cross-cutting" concerns must be addressed holistically to ensure the system is robust, reliable, maintainable, and meets its operational goals.

This section details the architectural strategies for:
* **Security:** Protecting the system and its data from threats and vulnerabilities.
* **Scalability:** Ensuring the system can handle growth in users, data, and processing load.
* **Resilience & Fault Tolerance:** Designing the system to withstand and recover from failures.
* **Cost Management & Optimization:** Implementing practices to manage and optimize operational costs on AWS.
* **Monitoring, Logging, & Observability:** Enabling visibility into the system's health, performance, and behavior.

Addressing these concerns proactively within the architecture is key to the long-term success and viability of the application.

## 6.1. Security Architecture (including Data Protection)

### 6.1.1. Introduction & Security Principles

Security is a paramount concern for the AI Loyalty Maximizer Suite, encompassing the protection of the application itself, its underlying infrastructure, and any data it processes or stores. While the initial conceptualization does not involve highly sensitive Personal Identifiable Information (PII) beyond user loyalty program affiliations and preferences, a "security by design" and "defense in depth" approach will be adopted, adhering to AWS best practices.

The core security principles guiding this architecture include:

* **Implement a Strong Identity Foundation:** Enforce the principle of least privilege and robust authentication/authorization mechanisms for all human and service access.
* **Enable Traceability:** Log, monitor, and audit actions and changes to the environment in real time.
* **Secure All Layers:** Apply security at all layers of the architecture, from the network edge to individual application components and data stores.
* **Protect Data in Transit and at Rest:** Encrypt all sensitive data wherever it resides or moves.
* **Automate Security Best Practices:** Leverage Infrastructure as Code and automated security checks within the CI/CD pipeline to build security into the development lifecycle.
* **Prepare for Security Events:** Implement mechanisms for incident response and recovery.

This subsection will detail the specific strategies for data protection, identity and access management, network security, application security, and security monitoring.

### 6.1.2. Data Protection

Protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data is a cornerstone of the security architecture. This involves multiple layers of defense, focusing on encryption, access control (detailed in IAM section 6.1.3), and data lifecycle management.

**A. Encryption in Transit:**

* **HTTPS/TLS for All External Communication:** All communication between end-user client applications and the `Conversational API` (via Amazon API Gateway) will be secured using HTTPS/TLS, encrypting data in transit over the public internet.
* **Encryption Between AWS Services:**
    * Interactions between AWS services within the VPC (e.g., Lambda invoking Bedrock, Step Functions calling Lambda, Lambda querying Neptune/DynamoDB) will leverage AWS's private network.
    * Where these services expose HTTPS endpoints (e.g., Bedrock, DynamoDB, S3, Neptune), communication will use TLS encryption by default.
    * VPC Endpoints (as detailed in Section 5.3.3.6) will be used extensively to ensure traffic to AWS services does not traverse the public internet, further securing data in transit within the AWS backbone.

**B. Encryption at Rest:**

All persistent data stores utilized by the AI Loyalty Maximizer Suite will be configured for encryption at rest to protect data from unauthorized access to the underlying storage.

* **Amazon S3:**
    * All S3 buckets used (e.g., for raw source documents, processed text, LLM-extracted facts, Neptune load files, application logs, backups) will have Server-Side Encryption enabled, at a minimum using SSE-S3 (Amazon S3-Managed Keys).
    * For enhanced security or specific compliance needs, SSE-KMS (AWS Key Management Service managed keys) can be utilized, allowing for customer-managed keys (CMKs) and more granular control over key rotation and access policies.
* **Amazon DynamoDB:**
    * The `User Profile Service` table(s) in DynamoDB will be encrypted at rest. DynamoDB encrypts all data at rest by default using AWS-owned keys. Options for using AWS KMS (customer-managed keys) are available for additional control.
* **Amazon Neptune:**
    * The Neptune graph database cluster (including its primary instance, replicas, automated backups, and snapshots) will be encrypted at rest using AWS KMS. This is a mandatory setting when creating a Neptune cluster.
* **AWS Lambda:**
    * Environment variables for Lambda functions that may contain sensitive configuration data will be encrypted at rest using AWS KMS.
* **AWS Glue Data Catalog & Job Bookmarks:**
    * Metadata in the Glue Data Catalog and job bookmarks can be encrypted using AWS KMS.
* **Amazon CloudWatch Logs:**
    * Log groups can be configured to be encrypted using AWS KMS.

**C. Data Classification (Conceptual):**

While the system, in its current conceptualization for core features, is not designed to store highly sensitive PII (such as financial details or government identifiers), a data classification approach would be prudent for a production deployment:

* **Sensitive Data:**
    * User profile information (e.g., user identifiers, associated loyalty program numbers, email addresses if collected for notifications or account management) will be treated as sensitive and subject to the strictest access controls.
    * Content of manually gathered source documents, while publicly available, will be handled with care, respecting any copyright or terms of use of the source websites.
* **Internal Data:** The derived knowledge graph itself, including the extracted rules and relationships, represents valuable intellectual property of the system.
* **Operational Data:** Logs and metrics might contain operational details but should be configured to avoid logging overly sensitive information.

A formal data classification exercise would identify data elements, their sensitivity levels, and drive specific handling and access control policies.

**D. Data Retention and Disposal (Conceptual):**

For a production system, clear data retention and disposal policies would be established:

* **User Data:** Policies would align with user consent, privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR's "right to erasure"), and business needs. Mechanisms for users to request data deletion would be considered.
* **Knowledge Graph Data:** A strategy for managing the lifecycle of loyalty rules within the graph will be important. This includes:
    * Archiving or soft-deleting outdated or superseded rules (leveraging `effectiveDate` and `expirationDate` properties).
    * Periodic reviews to remove irrelevant or erroneous data.
* **S3 Data Lifecycle Policies:** Amazon S3 lifecycle policies will be used to manage the retention of raw source documents, intermediate processed files, logs, and backups (e.g., transitioning older data to lower-cost storage tiers like S3 Glacier, and eventually deleting it after a defined period).
* **Log Retention:** CloudWatch Logs retention periods will be configured according to operational and compliance needs.

**E. Data Minimization:**

The principle of data minimization will be applied, meaning the system will only collect and store data that is essential for its defined functionalities. For example, detailed user travel history beyond what's needed for preference inference or saved itineraries would not be stored unless explicitly required for a new feature and consented to by the user.

This multi-faceted approach to data protection aims to secure data throughout its lifecycle within the AI Loyalty Maximizer Suite.
