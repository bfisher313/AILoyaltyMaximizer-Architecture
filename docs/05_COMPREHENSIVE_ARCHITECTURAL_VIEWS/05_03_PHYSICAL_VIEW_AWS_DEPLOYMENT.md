# 5.3. Physical View (Deployment Architecture on AWS)

## 5.3.1. Introduction

The Physical View, often referred to as the Deployment View, describes how the logical software components of the AI Loyalty Maximizer Suite are mapped to the physical (or, in this cloud-native architecture, virtualized) infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This view details the specific AWS services utilized, the network design within the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), strategies for ensuring high availability and disaster recovery, and the conceptual approach to managing different deployment environments.

Understanding the physical deployment is crucial for assessing operational aspects, security in depth, scalability mechanisms at the infrastructure level, cost implications, and the overall resilience of the application. This section provides a blueprint for how the suite would be realized and hosted within the AWS ecosystem.

Key aspects covered include:
* Mapping of logical containers (from Section 3.3) to specific AWS services.
* Detailed network architecture within Amazon VPC.
* High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR) strategies.
* Conceptual environment strategy (Dev, Staging, Production).
