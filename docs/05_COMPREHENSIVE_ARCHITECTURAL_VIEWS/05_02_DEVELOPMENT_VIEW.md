# 5.2. Development View (System Organization & Realization)

## 5.2.1. Introduction

The Development View addresses the architecture from the perspective of the engineers and teams responsible for building, testing, deploying, and maintaining the AI Loyalty Maximizer Suite. It outlines the organization of the software modules, key development practices, and the strategies for managing infrastructure and automating the deployment lifecycle.

This view is crucial for understanding how the system's components are realized as code artifacts and how they are brought into the operational environment. It complements the Logical View (which describes *what* the components are) and the Process View (which describes *how* they interact at runtime) by focusing on the *build-time* and *deployment-time* aspects.

This section will cover:
* Conceptual organization of the source code.
* Key development languages, frameworks, and libraries.
* Strategies for building and packaging deployable artifacts.
* The approach to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for provisioning and managing cloud resources.
* A conceptual overview of the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automating releases.
